<center>2016-03-19 09:00:00 +05:30</center>

<center><b>About GO-JEK</b></center>

GO-JEK is Indonesia's largest startup with > 11M app downloads since launch in Jan 2015. It is also the fastest growing startup in the world outside of China, posting 900x MoM growth since launch.

GO-JEK has recently <a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Deals/Motorcycle-app-acquires-Indian-software-companies">set up an R&D centre</a> in Bangalore, India, and is <a href="https://hasjob.co/go-jek.com/xt7n5">looking to hire the best hackers</a> in the country.

<center><b>Abstract:</b></center>
Implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> as a command line solution in Ruby.
  
<center><b>Prize:</b></center>
3 iPad minis for the top 3 code submissions.
  
<center><b>Rules of the game:</b></center>

1. You have until 9:00am on Sunday (i.e 24 hours from announcement) to submit your solution.

2. Your solution must be in Ruby and must be object oriented.

3. Your solution should be a command line application with a standard project structure expected in Ruby.

4. Usage of external gems/libs is only permitted for your specs eg. Test::Unit, RSpec, FactoryGirl etc.

5. Contract for your solution 
  
      a. It should reads from a file to obtain the seed, the filename should be passed via command 
      line arguments              
      
          Like -> `~$ ./gameoflife.rb seed.txt`
        
      b. It should run 50 iterations, printing the final iteration to STDOUT. 
      
      c. It should implement an infinite grid as per the problem statement. Limited grids will be 
      rejected.
         
      d. Sample seed and output format can be found below - 1 represents live cell and 0 represents 
      dead cell
         
      e. More examples can be found on the Wikipedia article linked to above

7. Your solution should comply with the input and output file formats below - we will be verifying the output using automated tests, so if you don't stick to the format your solution will not be accepted.

8. Solution does not need to validate seed input data, assume it is correct.

9. Solution should be published on github.com

10. Your solution must work for an infinite grid for any set of seed data. You do not need to handle out-of-memory issues for large seed data or seed data that generate substantial changes in 50 iterations.
  
11. Unit tests are mandatory. TDD is a huge plus.


  <center><b>Bonus Challenges:</b></center>

For each of the bonus challenges below that you complete in your solution, you get a massive boost to your score.

Please mention which challenges you have tackled in the README file in your project root among 'immutable', 'no if', 'no loop'.

1. Immutable: Your solution maximises use of immutable objects. The ideal is 0 mutating references in the entire codebase.

2. No if: Your solution does not use a single conditional. Please note that 'hacking' this by using a hash or ternary operator does not count, as one example.

3. No loop: Your solution does not use looping constructs.
  
  <center><b>How to enter:</b></center>

1. Your solution should be published on github.com under your github account as a new project.

2. Please tweet a link to the Github url of your project with the #GojekIndia #RubyConfIndia hashtags before 9:00am Sunday.
