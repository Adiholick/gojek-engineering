This website makes use of many great tools; tools that make my life as a developer easy and fun.

Portfolio is built with [Middleman](http://www.middlemanapp.com), an open source static site generator.

The CSS is written in Sass. The font used is Open Sans, and is served via Google Fonts. The photograph on the aboutpageâ€™s masthead is of me speaking at JoshTalks.

Feel free to take a look round.
